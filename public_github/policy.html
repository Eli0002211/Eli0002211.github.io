                <div class="hide">
                    <p>
                        INFERNO KARATE takes safeguarding concerns seriously: all instructors are DBS Enhanced cleared and undergo safeguarding training. The aim of the INFERNO KARATE is to enable our members to develop to their maximum potential in a safe and supportive environment. The following are minimum standards of safeguarding necessary to provide such an environment for children and vulnerable adults:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        (a) Instruction must take place in an “open” environment. Parents and carers should be able to observe the classes (albeit subject to conditions, such as a requirement that they do not interfere in the running of the lesson). Private situations behind closed doors are to be avoided. Children should not be encouraged to have “secret” discussions with adults in the club (although, this is different when a child is making a confidential disclosure- see (h));
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        (b) All members must be treated equally with regard to courtesy, support, encouragement and the opportunity to ask questions. Children should be encouraged to raise questions when they have them and to report anything which is worrying them;
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        (c) All members must be treated with dignity. Reducing a member to tears or humiliating a member as a means of discipline are inappropriate. Member to member bullying is also inappropriate;
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        (d) The welfare of a child member is paramount above winning or achieving goals. For example, it is not appropriate to
                        encourage a child of normal size and weight for their age to
                        attempt dieting in order to make a lighter weight;
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        (e) Whilst winning or achieving success is both laudable and to be encouraged, this is never to be done by sacrificing the
                    
                        overriding aim of child protection which is the welfare of the
                    
                        child It is the firm policy of INFERNO KARATE that a child’s welfare is enhanced by establishing in them an understanding of and commitment to fair play, enjoying sport, being modest in success and sporting in failure. INFERNO KARATE will not tolerate any behaviour at tournaments, gradings or other events which contradicts this policy;
                    </p> 
                    
                    <p>
                        (f) Instructors and professional staff may only make physical contact with children and vulnerable adults where necessary for safe technique execution and where the member has been warned in advance.
                    </p> 
                    
                    <p>
                        (g) Instructors and professional service staff are role models for children and vulnerable adults and must act as examples by not engaging in unprofessional or inappropriate activity while in the workplace;
                    </p> 
                    
                    <p>
                        (h) Instructors and professional staff must not make sexual comments or engage in sexual behaviour towards or in front of any member;
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        (i) Instructors and professional service staff should work in collaboration with parents, carers, and other agencies where appropriate. Instructors must inform the Safeguarding Lead should any safeguarding issues arise.
                    </p>
